<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This app was designed and developed during Covid pandemic for iOS devices. The app uses Rest API calls to get Covid statistics both worldwide and country specific by showing the countries both in list view and a map view. This was my first encounter with SwiftUI and I hope it helps your journey as well.</p>
